## Target variable 2a: # of incidents per 1000 people within a region

- [github issue](https://github.com/home-fire-risk/smoke_alarm_models/issues/22)
- [model document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oJN-QwLVqFHOvrRNtW2KEAkNZ-PuFiqTwa8y3iXx1Sg/edit)

2) Which areas are in most danger of having fires
Measure 1
- indicator: # of incidents per 1000 people within a region
- challenge: how to deal with regions where fire departments don’t report data
- inherent bias in coverage of NFIRS (ok for now).
- use state coverage to show confidence in estimates from NFIRS
- data source: NFIRS

By region we are refering census tract now. 
For each tract, calculate
- all structured fire incidents, this is the best approximate we can get for home fires.
- normalize fire incidents counts by tract population. Tracts with zero or less than 100 population were ignored, which could create unproportionate value. These places could be parks with small population and many fire incidents, but the inherent fire risk for each home are not necessarily significantly larger than other places.

### Discussion on NFIRS coverage

NFIRS didn't cover all fire departments. 69 percent of U.S. fire
departments reported fire incidents to NFIRS in 2011. Page 4 of [this document](https://www.usfa.fema.gov/downloads/pdf/statistics/data_sources_methodology.pdf) have a detailed table of the percentage of fire departments report to NFIRS for each state.

Ideally we would want to adjust this coverage bias. However the data available are very limited:

1. There is no existing complete fire department list. The National Fire Department
Census established by USFA only included 26,500 fire departments, 88 percent of the estimated number of U.S. fire departments. 
2. NFIRS don't have an up to date list of reporting fire departments either. There is a fire department file in NFIRS cd rom but it is outdated, some fire department even no longer exist.
3. For our project goal of protecting more homes, we better estimate NFIRS coverage by protected population instead of fire department count. The population protected by one fire department could vary a lot.
4. I believe counting one census tract as covered by NFIRS if there is ever reported incident in that census tract is the best estimate we can get for now. And I'm using all incidents reported to NFIRS (not limited in structure fire or fire incidents) and all reports across 2009 ~ 2013, so the coverage should be pretty complete. It is probably optimistic, but comparing the reporting fire department ratio with the covered population ratio in each state showed good correlation.
5. The fire incident per 1000 population from Red Cross diaster response data is roughly correlated to our indicator from NFIRS data.
